# MNIST_KNN_EXAMPLE_JS

A K nearest neibours classifier example run on the MNIST handwritten numbers dataset.

The dataset consists of 70k (60k training & 10k test) pre-classified greyscale 28x28 pixel images of handwritten numerals. This algorythm treats those images as vectors in a 784 (28^2) dimentional space. The test images are given the classifier most common to their 5 nearest neibours from the training set in this space.
